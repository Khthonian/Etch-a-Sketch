A work-in-progress implementation of an etch-a-sketch to showcase JavaScript interactions. Currently working on the ability for the user to manually change the grid size. Remaining tasks also include:
- CSS improvements
- Colour scheming
- Update the Etch-a-Sketch to change a cell colour on a mousedown
